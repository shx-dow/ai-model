# 🫀 Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to detect heart disease using patient data. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model selection (KNN & Random Forest), and performance evaluation.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/model.py`: Main model script
- `dataset/dataset.csv`: The dataset used
- `images/`: Visual diagrams (flowcharts, plots)
- `reports/`: Literature review, algorithm descriptions, etc.

## 🛠️ Algorithms Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📊 Results
- Best KNN Accuracy: 90.10%
- Random Forest Accuracy: 99.70%

## 📦 Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
